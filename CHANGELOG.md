# Changelog

All notable changes to Lazaret are recorded here. The Python (PyPI) and npm
packages share a version and are released together (see `docs/RELEASING.md`).
This log starts at 0.1.6; for earlier releases see the git history and tags.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com); the
project is pre-1.0, so the 0.x API may still change.

## [0.1.6] — unreleased

Received-code detection — the check for a value received over the network that
is then run as code — gained new sink families, cross-file coverage, and a
shared source of truth for both engines.

### Added
- **More received-code sinks (both engines).** Beyond running a received value
  (eval / `Function` / `vm` / a shell / an interpreter's inline code), the
  detector now flags:
  - **deserialization** of a received value — `pickle` / `marshal` /
    `jsonpickle`, an unsafe `yaml.load` (a `SafeLoader` / `safe_load` call is
    not), and node-serialize's `unserialize` (CWE-502);
  - **dynamic import of a received specifier** — `import(x)`, `require(x)`,
    `__import__(x)`, `importlib.import_module(x)`;
  - **download-to-file-then-run** — a received value written to a file that is
    then executed. This is a MAJOR-only signal (it is also the shape of a
    prebuilt-binary installer), so it never escalates an install hook to
    CRITICAL.
  A received value is also followed to a runner reached under an alias
  (`const e = eval; e(payload)`) or indirectly (`(0, eval)(…)`, `eval.call`,
  `window['eval']`).
- **Cross-file received code (Python engine).** A value received in one file of
  a dependency package and run in another — the source and the sink split
  across modules — is now caught under `--deps`, in both Python packages
  (`from ._c2 import pull; exec(pull())`) and npm packages
  (`const { pull } = require('./fetcher'); pull().then(c => eval(c))`).
  SC-IMPORT-RISK (MAJOR); the message names the source module. Detection runs
  only in the Python engine; the npm engine stays single-file with an honest
  gate, and the finding is excluded from the engine-parity comparison like the
  cross-file taint engine's `X-*` findings.

### Changed
- **Shared spec for the received-code detector.** Its data (name sets, character
  sets, limits) and all patterns (27 plain regexes and 6 alternation groups) are
  now authored once in `python/src/lazaret/scanner/received_spec.json` and
  compiled by both engines, synced by `scripts/sync-received-spec.py` and held
  together by a drift test. No behaviour change — the pattern text and name sets
  are byte-identical to before.

### Fixed
- The cross-file received-code pass no longer perturbs `--deps` stop / time-budget
  accounting: it had run an extra `should_stop` check that could swallow a stop
  reason and report a stopped scan as complete.
